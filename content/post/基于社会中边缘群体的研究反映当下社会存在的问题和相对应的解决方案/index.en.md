- 1. Research background and significance
This paper aims to reflect the existing problems and corresponding solutions in today's society through the study of marginalized groups in society. Marginal groups refer to people who are marginalized in society and may be discriminated against and excluded because of race, gender, age, religious beliefs, etc. These groups often face more challenges and difficulties, including insufficient employment opportunities, lack of educational resources, poor health and other problems.
First, this paper will explore the challenges and difficulties faced by marginalized groups in today's society. For example, marginalized groups may be affected by employment discrimination and insufficient educational resources, which makes it difficult for them to obtain good career and educational opportunities. In addition, marginalized groups may also face the problem of poor health because they may not be able to obtain high-quality health care services.
Second, this paper will propose some solutions to deal with these problems. For example, the government can protect the rights and interests of marginalized groups by formulating relevant laws, while providing more employment opportunities and educational resources. In addition, all sectors of society can also reduce discrimination and exclusion by strengthening publicity and education to improve people's awareness and understanding of marginalized groups.
Finally, this paper will summarize the research results and make recommendations. Through the study of marginalized groups, we can better understand the existing problems and corresponding solutions in today's society. These research results are helpful to promote social justice and equality, and promote social development and progress.
In short, this paper aims to reflect the existing problems and corresponding solutions in the current society through the study of marginal groups. We hope to contribute to social justice and equality through in-depth research and analysis.

### Concept and classification of marginal groups
- 1. Definition and characteristics of marginal groups
Marginal groups refer to people who are in a disadvantaged position in society, and their living and working environment is often discriminated against and excluded by society. These groups include the poor, the disabled, the elderly, ethnic minorities, etc. They are in a disadvantaged position in society and face many difficulties and challenges.
The characteristics of marginal groups mainly include the following aspects:
First, the living and working environment of marginal groups is often discriminated against and excluded by society. They face difficulties in employment, education, medical care, etc., and it is difficult for them to obtain fair opportunities and treatment. This discrimination and exclusion puts marginalized groups in a disadvantaged position in society and makes it difficult for them to obtain social resources and support.
Secondly, the living and working environment of marginalized groups often lacks basic security. They face multiple challenges such as poverty, unemployment, and health problems, and it is difficult for them to obtain basic living security. This lack of basic security puts marginalized groups in a disadvantaged position in society and makes it difficult for them to obtain basic living security.
Finally, the living and working environment of marginalized groups often lacks support and care. They face multiple problems such as loneliness and helplessness, and it is difficult for them to obtain social support and care. This lack of support and care puts marginalized groups in a disadvantaged position in society and makes it difficult for them to obtain social support and care.
In response to the problems faced by marginalized groups, we need to take a series of measures to solve these problems. First, we need to strengthen education and training for marginalized groups, improve their employment skills and quality levels, and provide them with more employment opportunities. Secondly, we need to strengthen medical and welfare security for marginalized groups, improve their quality of life and health level. Finally, we need to strengthen social support and care for marginalized groups and provide them with more help and support.
In short, marginalized groups are an important group in society, and they face many difficulties and challenges. Only by strengthening education, training, medical security, welfare security and other measures can we effectively solve the problems faced by marginalized groups and enable them to obtain a better living and working environment.
- 2. Classification and distribution of marginalized groups
Marginalized groups refer to a part of people who are excluded in society. They may be excluded because of race, gender, age, religious beliefs, poverty and other reasons. These people usually lack economic and social resources and do not receive sufficient social support, so they are more vulnerable to discrimination and exclusion. In modern society, the classification and distribution of marginalized groups are very complex. These groups may include:
1. Poor families: Due to economic reasons, these families cannot meet basic living needs, and their children may not be able to receive good education and medical care.
2. Minorities: In some countries, minorities may face discrimination and exclusion, and they may not be able to obtain fair employment opportunities and educational opportunities.
3. People with disabilities: People with disabilities may face physical and psychological barriers, and they may not be able to obtain normal work and education opportunities.
4. Sexual minorities: These groups may face discrimination and exclusion, and they may not be able to obtain fair employment opportunities and educational opportunities.
5. Young people: Young people may face problems such as difficulty in finding employment and high housing prices, and they may not be able to obtain stable jobs and housing.
In response to the problems of marginalized groups, we need to take a series of measures to solve these problems. First, the government should formulate relevant policies to protect the rights and interests of marginalized groups, such as providing more social welfare and educational opportunities. Secondly, enterprises should actively take measures to absorb marginalized groups, such as providing training and career development opportunities. Finally, we need to strengthen social awareness and cultural construction so that more people can understand the situation and needs of marginalized groups, thereby reducing discrimination and exclusion.
In short, marginalized groups are an issue in society that cannot be ignored. Only through the joint efforts of the government, enterprises and society can these problems be solved and a more fair, inclusive and diverse society be established.
### The status and influence of marginal groups in contemporary society
- 1. The role and function of marginal groups in society
The role and function of marginal groups in society has always been a topic of great concern. In today's society, the existence of marginal groups has become a common phenomenon, and they play an important role and function in society. This article will discuss the definition of marginal groups, the role and function of marginal groups in society, and how to solve the problem of marginal groups.
#### 1. Definition of marginal groups
Marginal groups refer to those who are on the margins of society. They are usually regarded as disadvantaged groups in society and lack economic, cultural and political support. These people may be excluded from mainstream society due to race, gender, age, religious beliefs, disability and other reasons. They usually lack education, employment opportunities and other important resources, so it is difficult for them to integrate into mainstream society.
#### 2. The role and function of marginal groups in society
- 1. Providing labor
Marginal groups are one of the poorest people in society. They often do not receive good education and training, nor do they get enough employment opportunities. Therefore, they often can only choose low-paying jobs or start their own businesses. These people provide cheap labor for society, allowing companies to adjust production plans more flexibly.
- 2. Protect the environment
Marginal groups usually live in suburban areas or remote areas, and they have a strong sense of environmental protection. They usually spontaneously participate in environmental protection activities, such as cleaning up garbage and planting trees. These behaviors help improve environmental quality and reduce pollution.
- 3. Promote cultural diversity
Marginal groups usually have rich cultural backgrounds and historical heritage, and their existence can promote the development of cultural diversity. They can spread their own culture and customs to mainstream society, so that people can better understand the differences and commonalities between different cultures.
#### III. How to solve the problem of marginal groups
- 1. Provide education and training opportunities
Providing education and training opportunities is one of the important ways to solve the problem of marginal groups. The government and enterprises can invest in the establishment of various training institutions to provide skills training and vocational education for marginal groups. This can help them improve their own quality and increase employment opportunities.
- 2. Improve living conditions
Improving the living conditions of marginal groups is also one of the important ways to solve the problem. The government can invest in the construction of public facilities, such as parks and libraries, to improve the quality of life of marginal groups. At the same time, the government can also strengthen the supervision and management of marginal groups to reduce their risk of discrimination and violence.
- 3. Strengthen cultural exchanges
Strengthening cultural exchanges is also one of the important ways to solve the problems of marginal groups. The government can organize various cultural exchange activities to allow different cultures to communicate and interact. This can promote the development of cultural diversity and enhance social cohesion.
In short, marginal groups play an important role and function in society. They contribute to society by providing labor, protecting the environment and promoting cultural diversity. At the same time, we should also pay attention to the living conditions of marginal groups and take effective measures to solve the problems they face. Only in this way can we build a more just, equal and harmonious
#### The impact and challenges of marginal groups on social development
Marginal groups refer to groups that are marginalized in society, including but not limited to the poor, the unemployed, ethnic minorities, etc. The existence of these groups has brought many challenges and problems to social development, and also proposed some solutions.
First, the existence of marginal groups will lead to an uneven distribution of social resources. Due to the lack of education, skills and resources of these groups, they are often unable to participate in social and economic activities, which leads to the aggravation of poverty and unemployment. This uneven distribution will also affect the economic development and social stability of the entire society.
Secondly, the existence of marginal groups will also have a negative impact on social culture. Due to the lack of education and cultural background, these groups often find it difficult to integrate into the mainstream culture, resulting in a reduction in cultural diversity. In this case, the mainstream culture may also be affected by marginal groups, triggering a series of cultural conflicts and contradictions.
In response to these problems, we need to take a series of measures to solve them. First, the government should increase its support for marginal groups and help them integrate into mainstream society by providing education, training and employment opportunities. Secondly, society should strengthen its attention and support for marginal groups and improve the public's awareness and understanding of marginal groups, thereby reducing discrimination and exclusion. Finally, we also need to attach importance to the protection and inheritance of cultural diversity, and promote the integration and exchange of different cultures through cultural exchange activities.
In short, marginal groups have brought many challenges and problems to social development, but social stability and development can only be achieved through the joint efforts of the whole society.
### The root causes and solutions to marginal group problems
- 1. The main causes and manifestations of marginal group problems
The problems of marginal groups in society are mainly manifested in two aspects: first, the imbalance of social development, which leads to the backwardness of some groups in terms of economy, education, employment, etc.; second, social injustice, which makes some groups discriminated against and excluded in terms of rights, opportunities and status. These problems reflect the problems existing in the current society and need to be solved.
First, we need to pay attention to the economic difficulties of marginal groups. Many marginal groups find it difficult to find high-paying jobs due to lack of education and skills, resulting in their income level being lower than that of the general population. Therefore, we should strengthen vocational training and skills improvement programs to help marginal groups improve their quality and competitiveness. In addition, the government should also introduce some support policies, such as tax cuts, lower loan interest rates, etc., to encourage companies to recruit marginal groups.
Secondly, we need to pay attention to the education problems of marginal groups. Many marginal groups cannot receive a good education due to their family background and economic conditions. Therefore, we should strengthen educational support for marginal groups, such as establishing more public schools, providing more scholarships and grants, etc. At the same time, we should also encourage companies to provide vocational training and skills improvement programs for marginal groups to help them improve their quality and competitiveness.
Finally, we need to pay attention to the social status of marginalized groups. Many marginalized groups are discriminated against and excluded due to race, gender, religion and other reasons. Therefore, we should strengthen publicity and education for marginalized groups and enhance people's understanding and respect for different groups. At the same time, the government should also introduce some policies, such as prohibiting discrimination and strengthening legal protection, to protect the rights and status of marginalized groups.
In summary, solving the problem of marginalized groups needs to start from multiple aspects such as economy, education, and social status. The government, enterprises and all sectors of society should work together to provide more support and help to marginalized groups so that they can integrate into society and enjoy equal opportunities and treatment.
- 2. Solutions and measures for marginalized group problems
In today's society, the problem of marginalized groups has become a social issue of concern. Due to poverty, unemployment, racial discrimination and other reasons, marginalized groups are in a disadvantaged position in society, and their rights and welfare are not guaranteed. Therefore, we need to take measures to solve this problem.
First, we need to strengthen education and training for marginalized groups. By providing more education and training opportunities, marginalized groups can be helped to improve their skills and enhance their competitiveness, so as to obtain better employment opportunities. In addition, we can also provide career counseling and guidance services to help them find a suitable career for themselves.
Secondly, we need to strengthen social security for marginal groups. The government should increase social security investment for marginal groups, provide more welfare and relief measures to help them through the difficulties. In addition, we can also establish some welfare programs specifically for marginal groups, such as subsidies for low-income families, unemployment benefits, etc.
Finally, we need to strengthen social integration for marginal groups. The government should take measures to promote communication and integration between different social groups and reduce social barriers and discrimination. In addition, we can also promote communication and integration between different social groups by establishing community service centers and organizing cultural activities.
In short, solving the problem of marginal groups requires joint efforts from the government, enterprises and all sectors of society. Only by strengthening education, providing more welfare and relief measures, and promoting social integration can we truly solve the problem of marginal groups and enable them to enjoy fair treatment and opportunities.
### Conclusion and Prospect
- 1. Summary and Evaluation of Research Conclusions
In today's society, the existence of marginal groups has attracted more and more attention. Marginal groups refer to those who are marginalized in society and lack social resources and support. These people may be marginalized due to race, gender, age, sexual orientation, etc. They are often discriminated against and excluded, lacking equal opportunities and resources. However, research shows that the existence of marginalized groups reflects some problems in today's society, and also provides corresponding solutions.
First, research shows that the existence of marginalized groups reflects the inequality problems in today's society. For example, ethnic minorities, women, and LGBTQ+ groups face greater challenges in education, employment, and health care. These problems need to be solved by formulating fair policies and laws to ensure that everyone has access to equal opportunities and resources.
Second, research shows that the existence of marginalized groups also reflects the cultural differences in today's society. For example, ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ groups, and people with disabilities may face challenges brought about by cultural differences. These problems need to be solved by promoting cultural diversity and inclusion to ensure that everyone can feel included and supported by society.
Finally, research shows that the existence of marginalized groups also reflects the social injustice problems in today's society. For example, ethnic minorities, women, and LGBTQ+ groups may face higher crime rates and lower income levels. These problems need to be solved by improving education, employment, and housing conditions to ensure that everyone has access to fair opportunities and resources.
In short, the existence of marginalized groups reflects some problems in today's society, but also provides corresponding solutions. By formulating fair policies and laws, promoting cultural diversity and inclusion, and improving education, employment and housing conditions, we can help marginalized groups gain equal opportunities and resources, thereby achieving social justice and inclusion.
- 2. Future research directions and suggestions
This paper explores the problems of marginalized groups in society and proposes corresponding solutions. Research shows that there are some marginalized groups in society, such as low-income families, people with disabilities, the elderly, etc., who face many difficulties and challenges in society. Therefore, this paper proposes the following solutions:
First, education and training for marginalized groups should be strengthened. This can help them improve their skills and enhance their employability, thereby improving their quality of life. At the same time, the government and enterprises should also strengthen their support and assistance to these groups and provide them with more employment opportunities and training resources.
Second, medical security for marginalized groups should be strengthened. This can help them better protect their health and safety. The government and society should increase investment in medical security and provide better medical services and security for marginalized groups.
Finally, social security for marginalized groups should be strengthened. This can help them better enjoy social welfare and services. The government and society should increase investment in social security for marginalized groups and provide them with better social security services.
In conclusion, this article believes that only by strengthening investment in education, medical care and social security can the problems faced by marginalized groups be better solved. Future research directions can further explore these aspects and provide more effective solutions to the problems of marginalized groups.
